## Abstract
The bambuco, one of the national rhythms of Colombia, is characterized by the presence of sesquialteras or the 
superposition of rhythmic elements from two meters. In this work, we analyze sesquialteras in bambucos from two 
perspectives. First, we analyze the perception of beat and meter by asking 10 Colombian musicians to perform beat 
annotations in a dataset of bambucos. Results show great diversity in the annotations: a total of five different meters 
or meter combinations were found in the annotations, with each bambuco in the study being annotated in at least two 
different meters. Second, we perform a beat tracking analysis in a dataset of bambucos with two state-of-the-art 
algorithms. Given that the algorithms used in the analysis were designed to deal with the rhythmic regularity of a 
single meter, it is not surprising that tracking performance is not very high (≃42% mean F-measure). However, a deeper 
analysis of the onset detection functions used for beat tracking, indicate that there is enough information on the 
signal level to characterize the bi-metric behavior of bambucos. With this in mind, we highlight possibilities for 
computational analysis of rhythm in bambucos.
